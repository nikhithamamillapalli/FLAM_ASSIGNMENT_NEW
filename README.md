# üî• Flam R&D Assignment ‚Äî Android + Web Prototype

## üìñ Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simple prototype of **Flam‚Äôs GenAI-powered immersive infrastructure**, focusing on real-time image processing using **C++ (NDK)**, **OpenCV**, and **Android JNI bridge**.  
It represents the foundational step towards creating high-fidelity AR/MR experiences without requiring an app download ‚Äî aligning with Flam‚Äôs vision of *‚ÄúThe Immersive & Interactive Layer for Every Screen & Surface.‚Äù*

The assignment consists of two main modules:
- **Android App (C++ + Kotlin + OpenCV)** ‚Äî performs real-time image processing (grayscale conversion / brightness enhancement) using JNI.
- **Web App (TypeScript + HTML + CSS)** ‚Äî lightweight demo showing similar image manipulation in-browser.
